This is a self project to help myself learn HTML, CSS, and JS. The application takes user inputs and logs the data to be stored in a JSON database to test fuctionality. It is very much a work in progress focusing more on the JS over the CSS currenlty and will clean up the CSS after most of the JS is working and complete.
