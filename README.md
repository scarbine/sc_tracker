This is a self project to help myself learn HTML, CSS and JS. The application takes user inputs and log the data to be stored in a tetd JSON database to test fuctionality. It is very much a work in progress focusing more on the JS over the CSS currenlty and will clean up the CSS after most of the JS is working an complete.
